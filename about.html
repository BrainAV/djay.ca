            <h2>About DJAY.ca</h2>
            <p>DJAY.ca was founded by Jason Brain, a Canadian DJ with 30 years of experience behind the decks. With a day job in computer programming and project management, Jason combined his passions to create a new generation of audio tools for fellow music lovers.</p>
            <p>The mission is to build powerful, accessible, and fun software for musicians, DJs, and producers. We believe that high-quality tools should be available to everyone, which is why we focus on browser-based applications that work on any device. We are just getting started and are excited to see what you create.</p>
