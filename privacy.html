            <p><em>Last updated: September 06, 2024</em></p>

            <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is DJAY.ca's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information
                we may collect from you across our website, <a href="https://djay.ca">https://djay.ca</a>, and other

            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by

                how it will be used.</p>

            <h3>Log Data</h3>
            <p>Like most website operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our site.
                This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser

            <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on
